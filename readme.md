# Ansible

- Ansible is an open-source configuration management tool, deployment and orchestration tool.
- Ansible uses YAML syntax for expressing Ansible playbooks. YAML is very easy for humans to understand, read and write when compared to other data formats like XML and JSON.
- Ansible is agentless, unlike Chef which requires an agent called chef-client.
- Ansible communicates using ssh whereas Chef needs a knife CLI to communicate.

### Now I have written some useful Ansible playbooks inside this repository. You can refer to them as per your requirement.
